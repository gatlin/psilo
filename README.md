**I START AND STOP THIS PROJECT EVERY FEW YEARS. THIS REPOSITORY HAS SOME COOL
STUFF IN IT THAT I WILL ASSUREDLY BE CANNIBALIZING BUT THIS ISN'T MORE THAN A
QUIRKY TYPE CHECKER YET**

***STAY TUNED***

This is an interpreter I'm writing. I've worked on it off and on for a long time
as I've learned more (which unfortunately causes me to want to destroy huge
portions of it and start over every so often).

The end result will be a strong, linearly typed, functional language with an
S-expression syntax and a relatively small core grammar.

As of now the linear part isn't done. Nor is the interpreter part. But I have a
reasonably sound implementation of a System F type inference engine with
rudimentary support for qualified types, so that's cool.

I've miles to go before I sleep ...
